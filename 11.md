NoSQL (Not Only SQL) represents a paradigm shift in database management, specifically designed to address the challenges of Big Data. Unlike traditional relational databases (RDBMS) that rely on strict schema and structured data, NoSQL databases offer flexibility, scalability, and high performance for managing large volumes of diverse and unstructured data.

**Limitations of Traditional RDBMS for Big Data:**

1. **Scalability:** RDBMS often struggle to scale horizontally, making it difficult to handle the ever-increasing volume of Big Data. Adding more servers typically requires complex data partitioning and replication, which can become a bottleneck.

2. **Data Variety:** RDBMS are optimized for structured data, but Big Data often includes unstructured and semi-structured data, such as social media posts, sensor data, and machine logs. Handling such diverse data formats efficiently is challenging for RDBMS.

3. **Performance:** The rigid schema and complex joins in RDBMS can lead to performance issues when dealing with Big Data. As data volume and complexity increase, query performance can deteriorate significantly.

**How NoSQL Addresses These Limitations:**

1. **Flexible Data Models:** NoSQL databases employ flexible data models, such as key-value, document, and graph structures, to accommodate diverse data formats without the constraints of a rigid schema.

2. **Horizontal Scalability:** NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing easy addition of new nodes to the cluster, distributing data and workload efficiently. This enables seamless scaling to handle massive data volumes.

3. **High Performance:** NoSQL databases employ simpler data structures and avoid complex joins, enabling faster data retrieval and manipulation, even with large and complex datasets.

In summary, NoSQL databases offer a more suitable approach for Big Data management, addressing the limitations of traditional RDBMS in terms of scalability, data variety, and performance. They provide the flexibility and agility required to handle the ever-growing and diverse nature of Big Data.
